**git fetch && git checkout master** -> Update your files to the latest.
Note: Whenever there are changes pushed to master you have to fetch the latest or else you're going to end up reverting w.e changes a person has done. So any time someone does a change, do this.  

**Git add filename.java** -> add a file that you've made changes to. 

**git push -u origin master** -> (update files, i.e. if you made changes to a file it will push the latest revision) 

**git commit -m "xxx"** -> where XXX is changes you've made to the code i.e removed bug in this or etc..
Please Use Commit so we can know what changes are made when. This is great for debugging.

These are simple commands. If you need more contact *Edgar* for further help.
